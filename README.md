# ITD_ACT3 - UK Road Accident Analysis  

🚗 **Analyzing UK road accident data using multivariate analysis and correlation-based insights.**  

## 📌 **Overview**  
This project is part of my ITD coursework, focusing on **data aggregation, correlation analysis, and multivariate statistical methods** to uncover patterns in UK road accidents.

```sh
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```
